The Node class serves as the building block for linked lists. It represents a single element in the list and holds two key pieces of information:

Data: The data associated with the node.
Next: A reference to the next node in the list.
By creating a Node class, you define the structure of each element in the linked list. This allows you to:

Store data: Each node can hold a specific value or object.
Link nodes together: The next reference in each node connects it to the next node in the list, forming the chain-like structure.
Traverse the list: You can start at the head node and follow the next references to visit each node in the list.
Without a Node class, you wouldn't have a way to represent individual elements in the linked list and connect them together. Therefore, creating a Node class is a fundamental step in implementing a linked list.

we should have to crate a Node class 
always to use a link list
